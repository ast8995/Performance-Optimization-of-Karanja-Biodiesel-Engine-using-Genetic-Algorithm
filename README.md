# Performance-Optimization-of-Karanja-Biodiesel-Engine-using-Genetic-Algorithm
This repository contains a report on the project I led to to  optimize  the direct  injection (DI)  single  cylinder diesel engine with respect to engine characteristics through experimental investigations and Genetic Algorithm. When biodiesel is used as a substitute for diesel, it is highly essential to understand the parameters that affect the combustion phenomena which will in turn have direct impact on the output. The aim of the project was to find a combination of a blend comprising of karanja biodiesel, and other measuring parameters which would increase the performance of diesel engine with minimum emissions from the engine.
